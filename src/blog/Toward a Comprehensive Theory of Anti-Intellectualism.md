# Introduction

TO BE WRITTEN

In this post, I would like to explain why I am so interested in anti-intellectualism, and what I think needs to be about it. I am coming from a pragmatist background, but one that remains very invested in separating the good inferences from the bad ones. So, I would need to explain the tension between those two things, and how they are resolved. Next, I would need to explain how my own silly idea of a semantic drive interacts with these things, finally, I would need to make a serious effort to describe the solution.

Like, I think this is an interesting question because it is so relevant, and then a further interesting question because of all of the things a comprehensive theory would need to account for. The tension is between my belief that we need to separate out the good inferences from the bad ones, so the idea that truth (in the real world) is not isomorphic to false, but that internally, that true beliefs and false beliefs are more or less indistinguishable. 

So, in order to understand why this is an interesting thing, a reader would need to be familiar with inferentialism generally, and then my more specific version that also cares about like, truth of actual propositions. 

So: The operant question, why is anti-intellectualism so attractive to so many people, why is it such a destructive force, and what needs to be done to refute it. Can we therapize our way out of this? Is there reason to believe that what would fix a lone crank could fix a Senatorial crank?
