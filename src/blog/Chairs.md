description: I'm gonna talk about chairs in this one :)
title: Trust comes before communication

The basic idea for this one is that I want to begin at a distinction between essentialism and anti-essentialism, and explain this in terms of what we are doing when we talk *about* things. Like, the metaphor is that there are two ways that I could read the sentence "there is a chair over there" the first one is logical, as in, there is a thing that is a "chair" before it is anything else, something that has a chair like essence. 

Then, I'd like to talk about how it's a good thing that anti-essentialism has become more mainstream in the discourse. Like, from a purely ethical perspective, it is a good thing that we have been able to slowly move away from "are women/families/races essentially X, or essentially Y," and toward questions like "what isa good way of engaging with feminist/family/racial politics" Like, it's a good thing that, among the left at least, it is enough to show that a politic/way of speaking/etc is useful, respectful, sustainable, feasible, etc, without having to do more work to show that it is also metaphysically valid. I find those kinds of discussions tiring, and the farther we move away from questions like "does x correspond to the ideal form of x," the better.

However, even as we move away from discussions surrounding essences, they have still enshrined themselves in the discourse. It seems to be very important to people that they are taken to be accurate reporters of their own essences. As in, if someone holds fast to identity X, it matters a lot to them that they are "really" X. I think that this way of thinking is nonsense.

In order to make my point clear, I think it is necessary to talk about this in terms of gender. This is clearly unfortunate for me, seeing as I am a cis person with uncomplicated feelings toward my own. Nevertheless, I think it is the most direct example of what I am talking about.

In the same way that the sentence "x is a chair" ended up, in the final analysis, to be about ways that we find it coherent to relate to an object, statements like "x is a women" are statements about how we can coherently relate to another person. As such, the statement "I am a woman" is nothing more than a desire to be interacted with in some manner. This manner might be different for different people, but, it is a purely social thing (now, there is probably some underlying reason for why some people's life satisfaction is related to being treated like a sex other than the one they were assigned at birth, but the underlying reason is unimportant. We could discover that there is a single gene on a single chromosome that determines it, or we could discover that there are hundreds of independent factors which express themselves differently in different people, none of which are causal on their own, and the interactions of which are opaque). The actual thing that we are able to interact with is the expression of preferences. 

It's worth pausing on the word preferences, and the more general way that these kinds of inferential readings tend to imply a certain frivolousness. The word preference is used to be maximally general and philosophically noncommittal. You have a "preference" that your family not be tortured to death in front of you, and you have a preference of blue raspberry over red raspberry. Further, there might be some underlying "reason" for these preferences, and even a serious sense in which some preferences are more correct than others, but we could still call all of them preferences. 

The point that I am building up to is that the trivial judgement that something is a chair is possible because we find ourselves in a community with a basic level of trust. It is impossible to separate the conditions that make communication possible from the conditions that should lead to an acceptance of trans people. The basic components are the same, ethical, political, and even intellectual life are predicated on these norms of discourse. There is no coherent way to separate the two from each-other. 

This is the basic outline 
- introduce chairs
- introduce social theories of meaning
- seemingly unfortunate
