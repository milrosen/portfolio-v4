# Why I don't

I, like many modern philosophers, find many metaphysical debates very boring. I feel correct to characterize them as mostly a meandering search for the best-est definitions, or sometimes to answer one of several meaningless questions. 

Metaphysics, as I'm using the word, is the search for the fundamental truths of being, the kinds of questions that can't be answered by (current) science. These can be far-ranging, but tend to follow a few themes. First, questions about the origins of the universe, or of the logical properties of such an origin. These would be questions like "can there be uncaused causes?" "how could something come from nothing?" "is the universe eternal." The second big category concern how we relate to the world, questions like "does free will exist?" "what is the meaning of life?" (particularly if you think meaning comes from without rather than within), "does time exist, or is it just something our brains made up?" are all part of the second type. All of these questions are mostly grouped under the banner of metaphysics for historical reasons, but they do share some things in common. Firstly, they are generally concerned with truths that are eternal in some way. If we could come up with a good answer for any of them, they would either always be true or never be true. They also all try to get at the "most fundamental" properties of the universe. Like, if you start with "why is X true" and then ask "ok, but why is *that* true," of any response, you almost always end up at a metaphysical question.

Given that some people think philosophy is *only* about asking metaphysical questions, it might be surprising that I said many philosophers actively dislike them. However, this is not a new position. Since the dawn of the enlightenment (and before) people have been nobly shrugging away these fundamental questions. The most robust of these shruggers was probably Kant. He argued (among other things) that since we only ever perceive things in causal, temporal and spatial ways, time and space are "built in" to our knowledge, and so we just aren't the kinds of creatures that could argue our way out of our built in definitions. 

As philosophy moved through several subsequent eras, people have become more and more skeptical that metaphysical questions have any content whatsoever. The the positivists argued that we could only talk about direct experience and the logical propositions we make about it. The postmodernists attacked overblown promises of unity and eternity. The existentialists tried to reorient our thinking around being *in* the world, rather than the world itself. Uniting all of these thinkers was a belief that the metaphysical heavy-hitters were at best unanswerable and at worst, nonsensical to even ask.
