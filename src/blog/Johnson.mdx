# What is a Johnson formula?

## Notation

For this post, I will be using a slightly nonstandard logical notation that generalizes easily to Johnson formulas. Specifically, modified Boolean notation where multiplication/adjacency is $\wedge$ and $+$ is $\vee$. So, for example, we might represent $A\vee B$ as $A+B$, and $A\wedge B$ as $AB$. Another notational trick is representing every expression in negation normal form. Meaning that negation can only apply to variables, not parenthesis. This means that we can use lowercase letters to represent the negation of the variable. So to write $\neg (A+B)$ we would need to distribute the negation, $\neg A \times \neg B$, and then could simplify to $ab$. Note that this notation is a bit misleading, since in the standard choice for representing Boolean algebra, the $0, 1$ field, $+ = \oplus$ (xor) not $\vee$. Instead, you could pretend that we're in $\mathbb{N}_0$, that $x = 0 \rightarrow False$, $x \not= 0 \rightarrow True$, and finally $\neg x = 1 -\frac{x}{|x-1|+1}$, and then everything else works out.
## The problem

A Johnson formula is designed for a very specific task: turning a proposition in Disjunctive Normal Form (or of ands, DNF) into a set of implications. For a simple example, we could look at the formula $A+b$, and see that it is equivalent to $a \rightarrow b$. It is very easy to perform this going from a CNF formula since clauses are basically just implications. So $(C+A+b)(B+a+c)$ can be transformed into $(c \rightarrow Ab)(AC \rightarrow B)$, along with any other reordering of the clauses. However, it requires some genuine algebra to see that those same implications also follow from $BC + aC + Abc$ as well. To make that kind of algebra Easier, Johnson proposed a 2d notational system to visualize the common operations going from one to the other.

# 2D Formulas

In Johnsons system, formulas aren't confined to a single dimension, but instead are able to express their relations in 2D space. Two variables are placed on top of each other to represent $A+B$ and adjacent to each other to represent $AB$ (hence the boolean notation). So, for example, if we wanted to write the CNF formula from earlier, we could write it as: 

$$
\begin{array}{c}
BC \\ \hline
aC \\ \hline
Abc \\
\end{array}
$$

To see how to transform formulas, it's easier to start with simpler examples. For instance, going from $AB + AC$ to $A(B + C)$ is very straightforward in Johnson notation:
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\begin{array}{cc}
AB \\ \hline
AC
\end{array} &
\rightarrow &
\begin{array}{c|c}
A & B \\ \hline
A & C
\end{array} & \rightarrow &
\begin{array}{c|c}
A & \begin{array}{c} B \\ C \end{array}
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$
And it's easy to see that going back is just as straightforward. The middle step can be eliminated, but I feel like including it makes the distribution more clear, as well as getting us to the most interesting part of Johnson formulas. 

The cross in the center of the middle formula might've struck you as quite strange, since it's no longer obvious what order of operations we are representing. The formula could faithfully be rendered as $AB+AC$ or as $(A+A)(B+C)$. In this case, the two are exactly equivalent, but in general, $XY + ZW \not= (X+Z)(Y+W)$. The above special case, $X=Z$ isn't very interesting, but the equality *also* holds when $X=\neg W$, so $XY + Zx = (X+Z)(x+Y)$ $=$ $Xx + XY + Zx + ZY$ $=$ $XY + xZ + ZY$, and then we can note that $ZY \rightarrow XY + xZ$, so the $ZY$ term is redundant. This mini-proof means that this unique quad-formula really doesn't have to worry about parenthesis, unlocking a unique and powerful way to reduce formulas, expressable only in two dimensions.
$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
X & Y \\ \hline
Z & x
\end{array}
$$
We can now represent both equivalent formulas at the exact same time, freely switching between the two interpretations whenever. Additionally, it makes reading off the implications very easy and semantically meaningful, in this case, those would be $a \rightarrow D$ and $A \rightarrow B$. 

The sheer convenience of Johnson notation might not be obvious yet, but we can try a longer example, and hopefully the ease of translating between one formula to the next becomes obvious. We will stick with the same general task, going from a DNF formula and trying to turn it into a set of implication relations.

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\begin{array}{c}
ABC \\ \hline
BCD \\ \hline
aBc \\ \hline
BcD \\ \hline
AbD \\ \hline
abCd
\end{array} & = &
\begin{array}{c}
BCA \\ \hline
BCD \\ \hline
Bac \\ \hline
BDc \\ \hline
ADb \\ \hline
Cdab
\end{array} & = &
\begin{array}{c|c}
B & \begin{array}{c}
CA \\ \hline
CD \\ \hline
ac \\ \hline
Dc \\ 
\end{array} \\ \hline
\begin{array}{c}
AD \\ \hline
Cad
\end{array} & b
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$
$$
= \begin{array}{c|c}
B & 
	\begin{array}{c|c} 
		C  & \begin{array}{c} A\\ D\end{array} \\ \hline
		\begin{array}{c} a \\ D \end{array}& c
	\end{array} \\ \hline
\begin{array}{c|c}
A & D \\ \hline
Cd & a
\end{array} & b
\end{array}
$$

In the first step, we went line-by-line, finding the most common variable, either positive or negative, in this case, $B$, which is present in every single clause in the formula. Next, we shifted it to the right if it was positive, and left if it was negative. Then, we performed the same operation the remaining clauses and variables in the rest of the formula, realizing that in the $B$ formulas, $C$ appeared either positively or negatively in each, and then shifted $C$ as far left as it could go before hitting $B$ and $c$ to the right. We did the exact same thing with $A$ in the bottom left subformula. 

After reordering the variables, all that's left is some very easy grouping. The final formula now acts as a very efficient representation of all the implication relations. Each vertical line is a valid clause, and using the same principle from earlier, we can turn the clauses into implication relations, following whatever ordering makes the most sense. For the vertical slice on the far right, we would get $B + A + Cd$, and we could turn that into an implication relation by negating the first few terms, $ba \rightarrow Cd$. 

In addition to getting these formulas working, I've added an automatic interpreter of the Johnson formulas (though it doesn't handle that special case yet)
