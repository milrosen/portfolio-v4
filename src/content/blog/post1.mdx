Hopefully, this post can be an opportunity for me to get my thoughts in order. I would like to explain what a Wittgenstein-influenced understanding of language is and then argue that it is a good and useful thing to keep in mind even for nonphilosophers. 

# Whatgenstein

First, I should explain the basics. There are a few definitions of language, but for the purpose of this post, I will assume that the reader is beginning with the "conceptual" definition of language, and explain why the "picture" view is better. After that sentence, you had one of two reactions. Either, you have no clue what those words mean, or you're mad at me for not including a few more. If you're in the first group, then hopefully the rest of this can be useful for you. If you are in the second bear with me.

## the conceptual view

I consider this to be the default, uncomplicated view of language. The conceptual view suggests that we have several concepts in our brain (fish, horses, moral oughts), and then we assign a word to each of those concepts. We make sure our concepts match up with other people's by talking to them.

When I was a child, my father pointed at several things. After pointing at one, he said "Chair." Turning to another thing, maybe a couch, he said "Not chair." Eventually, I learned several *necessary and sufficient conditions* for various words. A chair was a chair if I could sit on it. And it was good. 

Unfortunately, one day a philosopher came to town. He stood in the center of town and loudly declared that we had no idea what our words meant. Knowing that this was obviously foolish, I walked up to him and told him that I used words every day, and if he didn't know what they meant, that he must be the stupid one. He responded by asking me what a chair was. Proudly, I told him that a chair is a thing I can sit on. He took a seat right there on the sidewalk and asked me if it was a char. Of course not, I said, I have to be able to pick up a chair -- it can't be attached to the ground. He pointed at a rock and asked if it was a chair. Of course not, I said, a chair has to have four legs and a back. He pointed at a horse and asked me if it was a chair. I said of course not, a horse is a horse and horses are not chairs. He laughed, agreed with me, and decided to move on.

After the philosopher left town, I became distraught. What, if I *didn't* know what my words meant. I knew there must be a correct concept I could appeal to. After all, I had known each time, effortlessly, what was and wasn't a chair. I had no difficulty sorting each and every object into chair and not chair, I must be doing it according to some rule. Moreover, everyone around me likewise could separate the world into chairs and not chairs. Surely, if we all agreed on what a chair means, we must be agreeing to *something.*

To summarize: the conceptual view of language has a sharp divide between concepts and words. Concepts live in our heads and are comprised of necessary and sufficient conditions. Words are little sticky notes that we put on concepts. I can use words to make new concepts, and if I'm using a word, there must be some underlying concept that I am referring to, even if I have a hard time making it explicit.

Put even more simply:

$$words = concepts$$

## the picture view

The picture view of language stantds in opposition to the conceptual view. It argues that, instead of representing concepts in my brain, language acts more like a picture. It describes the world, the ways the world has been or could be, but nothing more. This may seem unreasonable at first, it seems to say that huge chunks of day-to-day speech -- moral arguments, logical truths, math, even just talking about my feelings -- aren't actually language! Surely this can't be.

After the philosopher came to town, changing my life forever, I managed to become a grad student at Cambridge, where I spent my days discovering the necessary and sufficient conditions for everything. My definition of chair was iron-clad (much like some chairs). I was unstoppable. 

Unfortunately, while I was studdying, a young man, named Wittgenstein, published an absolutely incomprehensible rant he called the *Tractatus Logico Philosophicus.* It was numbered like a math proof, but instead of proving that $1+1=2$, or something sensible like that, he claimed to prove that, "whereof one cannot speak, one must be silent" -- barely even a claim! It even began by saying, "This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in it -- or similar thoughts." Who on earth writes like that. I'd even heard rumors that he refused any edits, sending angry letters to the dean of admission: if they couldn't see his genius, wouldn't simply grant him a degree for the *Tractatus,* then they weren't really philosophers. 



You might notice that we all seem to use language in dozens of ways that don't seem to fit this description. You might even notice that pictures themselves can do way more than simply describe the world. This is true, but beyond the scope of the post. Read Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations* for more info on how complex a picture can get!

$$sentences = pictures$$
