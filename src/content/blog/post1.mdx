Hopefully, this post can be an opportunity for me to get my thoughts in order. I would like to explain what a Wittgenstein-influenced understanding of language is and then argue that it is a good and useful thing to keep in mind even for nonphilosophers. 

# Whatgenstein

First, I should explain the basics. There are a few definitions of language, but for the purpose of this post, I will assume that the reader is beginning with the "conceptual" definition of language, and explain why the "picture" view is better. After that sentence, you had one of two reactions. Either, you have no clue what those words mean, or you're mad at me for not including a few more. If you're in the first group, then hopefully the rest of this can be useful for you. If you are in the second bear with me.

## the conceptual view

I consider this to be the default, uncomplicated view of language. The conceptual view suggests that we have several concepts in our brain (fish, horses, moral oughts), and then we assign a word to each of those concepts. We make sure our concepts match up with other people's by talking to them and making sure that we use words in the same way.

When I was a child, my father pointed at several things. After pointing at one, he said "Chair." Turning to another thing, maybe a couch, he said "Not chair." Eventually, I learned several *necessary and sufficient conditions* for various words. A chair was a chair if I could sit on it. And it was good. I also learned a few more words, I learned that some actions were good, and some were bad. Within my skull, I learned some reasons why things were good, and reasons why things were bad. It was bad when I hit my brother, and good when I walked old ladies across the street. I came to intuit a pattern, things were good when they increased the amount of pleasure in the world, and bad when they decreased it. And this too was good.

Unfortunately, one day a philosopher came to town. He stood in the center of town and loudly declared that we had no idea what our words meant. Knowing that this was obviously foolish, I walked up to him and told him that I used words every day, and if he didn't know what they meant, that he must be the stupid one. He responded by asking me what a chair was. Proudly, I told him that a chair is a thing I can sit on. He took a seat right there on the sidewalk and asked me if it was a char. Of course not, I said, a chair has to have legs, it can't be attached to the ground. He pointed at a rock and asked if it was a chair. Of course not, I said, a chair has to have four legs and a back. He pointed at a horse and asked me if it was a chair. I said of course not, a horse is a horse and horses are not chairs. He laughed, agreed with me, and decided to move on. He asked me what the good was. I said, "Something is good if it increases the amount of pleasure in the word, and bad if it decreases it." He asked me if depriving people of their right to vote increased the amount of pleasure in the world, would it be a good thing? I said of course not, rights are right, not wrong. He laughed and wandered off.

After the philosopher left town, I became distraught. What, if I *didn't* know what my words meant. I knew there must be a correct concept I could appeal to. After all, I had known each time, effortlessly, what was and wasn't a chair. I had no difficulty sorting each and every object into chair and not chair, I must be doing it according to some rule. Moreover, everyone around me likewise could separate the world into chairs and not chairs. Surely, if we all agreed on what a chair means, we must be agreeing to *something.* And the same thing, I thought, must be true about each word, we can all agree that kicking a puppy is bad and that charity is good, we must be using some definition of "good." Surely we are all agreeing to *something.*

To summarize: the conceptual view of language has a sharp divide between concepts and words. Concepts live in our heads and are comprised of necessary and sufficient conditions. Words are little sticky notes that we put on concepts. I can use words to make new concepts, and if I'm using a word, there must be some underlying concept that I am referring to, even if I have a hard time making it explicit.

Put even more simply:

$$words = concepts$$

## the picture view

$$sentences = pictures$$
